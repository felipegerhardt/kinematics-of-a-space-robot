# Kinematics and kinetics of a space robot - 2D Simulation

## Introduction
---

This repository aims to perform numerical simulation of a robot arm under different conditions using the following open source libraries:

- Sympy;
- Scipy;
- Numpy.

For animation and graphic visualization purposes, the following libraries are needed:

- Matplotlib;
- Pydy.
