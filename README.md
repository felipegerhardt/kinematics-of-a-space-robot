# Kinematics and kinetics of a space robot - 2D Simulation

## Introduction

This repository aims to perform numerical simulation of a robot arm under different conditions using the following open source libraries:

- Sympy for symbolic mathematics;
- Scipy for scientific computing;
- Numpy for array manipulation;
- Pydy for multibody dynamics.

For animation and graphic visualization purposes, the following libraries are needed:

- Matplotlib;
- Pydy.viz;

---

## Inspiration

Aboard the International Space Station (ISS) there is a robotic system that plays a key role in station assembly and maintenance. The Mobile Servicing System (MSS) moves equipment, supplies, support astronauts, services instruments and other payloads. The MSS is composed of three main components:
- the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), known as Canadarm2, see Fig. 1.;
- the Mobile Remote Service Base System (MBS);
- the Spcial Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM - or "Dextre"/"Canada hand").
